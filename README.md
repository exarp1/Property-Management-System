#Property Management System

This is a partial implementation of a property management system my team and I
worked on in winter/spring 2015 for our Systems Analysis and Design Class. I was
in charge of documentation and a fair portion of the Landlord Forms you will
find here. Unfortunately, Github does not host a PHP server or a DB server, so 
you'll have to view the files directly. Notably, I worked on the PDF printing
code to allow the landlord to generate printable pdfs from the forms he fills
within the App. Feel free to Browse around. Credit for the DB stuff and most
Javascript goes to Chris and Riley. Ed and I did the PHP forms and PHP to PDF
code.
